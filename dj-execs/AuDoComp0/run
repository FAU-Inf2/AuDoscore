# Compare wrapper-script to be called from 'testcase_run.sh'.
#
# Usage: $0 <testdata.in> <program.out> <testdata.out> <result.out> <diff.out>
#
# <testdata.in>   File containing testdata input.
# <program.out>   File containing the program output.
# <testdata.out>  File containing the correct output.
# <result.out>    File describing the judging verdict.
# <diff.out>      File to write program/correct output differences to (optional).

# Exits successfully except when an internal error occurs. Submitted
# program output is considered correct when diff.out is empty (and
# specified).
#
# This script calls another program to check the results.
# Calling syntax:
#
#    $CHECK_PROGRAM <testdata.in> <program.out> <testdata.out>
#
# The $CHECK_PROGRAM should return the contents of <diff.out> to
# standard output. It must exit with exitcode zero to indicate
# successful checking.

# Check program. The default program name below is defined by
# replacing 'compare_' by 'check_' in this programs name. So by
# copying or symlinking this default 'compare_wrapper' to
# compare_<your_compare>, the program 'check_<your_compare>' will be
# called; modify as required.
