Student + Cleanroom:
- DON'T use inner or sibling classes -> only one (public) class per file
- DON'T make anything final or private unless you know what you are doing

Cleanroom:
- DON'T use super in the cleanroom, studens may use super in their solutions
- DON'T replace constructors, use init-methods instead
